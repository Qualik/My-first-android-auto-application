# My-first-android-auto-application

- This is a basic Android app that also supports "Android Auto"
- Contains a text field
- When text is inputted and the 'Send' button is click the messge is displayed on the screen

## Still to add

- Accessibility so that the message is read back to the user

### Issues

- Still trying to work out a way to build in a screen-reader function, namely 'Talkback' into the app
